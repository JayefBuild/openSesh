# Handoff: {{FROM_CHUNK}} → {{TO_CHUNK}}

## What I Completed

<!-- Mark completed items with [x], incomplete with [ ] -->

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

---

## Files Created

<!-- List ALL files you created with full paths -->

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `path/to/file.swift` | ~100 | Brief description |
| `path/to/tests.swift` | ~150 | Test file description |

---

## Files Modified

<!-- List ALL files you modified -->

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `path/to/existing.swift` | What you changed and why |

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Decision Title

**Decision:** What you decided
**Rationale:** Why you chose this (be specific, not "it seemed best")
**Alternatives Considered:** What else you considered and why you rejected it

### 2. Decision Title

**Decision:**
**Rationale:**
**Alternatives Considered:**

## Code Patterns Established

<!-- Document patterns the next worker MUST follow -->

### Pattern Name

```swift
// Example code showing the pattern
// Include enough context to understand and replicate
```

**When to use:** Describe when this pattern applies

---

## Context for Next Chunk

<!-- This is the most important section. Write 500+ words. -->
<!-- The next worker only knows what you tell them here. -->

### System Overview

<!-- Explain the system you built/modified at a high level -->

### How It Works

<!-- Explain the flow, data model, key components -->

### Critical Constraints

<!-- List constraints the next worker must respect -->

- Constraint 1
- Constraint 2

### State Diagram (if applicable)

```
[State A] --event--> [State B] --event--> [State C]
```

### What the Next Worker Needs to Know

<!-- Specific information critical for the next chunk -->

1. Point 1
2. Point 2
3. Point 3

---

## Integration Notes

<!-- Show HOW to use what you built with code examples -->

### Example: Use Case Name

```swift
// Complete, runnable example
// showing how to integrate with your work
```

### Example: Another Use Case

```swift
// Another example if applicable
```

---

## Remaining Work

<!-- Be honest about what's not done -->

- [ ] Item not completed (reason why)
- [ ] Item deferred (reason why)

Or: "None - chunk is fully complete."

---

## Blockers / Issues Encountered

<!-- Document problems for awareness -->

- Issue 1: Description and how you handled it
- Issue 2: Description and workaround

Or: "None - implementation went smoothly."

---

## Tests Status

- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Test count: X tests
- [ ] Coverage: ~X% (if measured)

---

## Git Commits

<!-- List your commits for reference -->

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `abc1234` | feat(scope): description |
| `def5678` | test(scope): description |

## Context Usage

**Final:** ~XX% (XXk tokens)
**Peak:** ~XX% (XXk tokens)

<!-- Note if you had to wrap up early due to context limits -->
